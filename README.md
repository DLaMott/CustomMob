# CustomMob
This plugin adds a Custom Mob to a player's world. The Mob spawns after a player places "Grass_Block" a random number of times. The Entity steals the player's loot, runs away,
and will drop items as the player hits or kills the entity. Over time I will make the plugin have more customization by adding the ability to make the entity type,
entity name, and items able to be changed in the provided configuration file.

Thank you!
